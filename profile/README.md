# DeepSecurity

**Our mission is to elevate cybersecurity posture in Latin America.**

[DeepSecurity](https://www.deepsecurity.pe) is a Latam offensive security company specialized in helping organizations plan, build, and execute successful cybersecurity programs. We use the same tools and techniques real-world adversaries use — before they get the chance. Our services span Penetration Testing, Red Team operations, Bug Bounty programs, Web Application Security, Incident Response, Source Code Review, and CISO as a Service.

Our research team has published CVEs, earned recognition in the Hall of Fame programs of **Microsoft, Apple, PayPal, X, Netflix and ProtonMail**, and has been an active part of the **OWASP Peru Chapter since 2015**. We are pioneers of the **Zero Trust model** in Peru and operate across **Peru, Ecuador, Colombia and Mexico**.

## Open Source Tools

As part of our commitment to the security community, the DeepSecurity Research team builds open tools for offensive security practitioners:

- [**Introspector**](https://github.com/DeepSecurityResearch/Introspector) — Swiss-Army Knife for advanced OOB exploitation. Not just a callback server — Introspector fingerprints client behavior, assesses attack surface, and delivers exploits. Features unified HTTP/DNS listeners, passive redirect behavior detection, payload arsenal (XXE, SVG bombs, CSV injection, pixel floods, etc), file hosting, custom response designer, GeoIP + WHOIS intel, and persistent sessions across restarts.

## Research

The DeepSecurity team publishes original research on the Latin American threat landscape. Some highlighted work:

-  **Mobile Homebanking Security Report — Peru** — Passive analysis of 12 Peruvian banking apps under the OWASP Mobile Top 10 standard
-  **BlueKeep Analysis in Peru (CVE-2019-0708)** — Identified 500+ vulnerable Peruvian servers exposed to unauthenticated remote code execution
-  **Operation APAKUY** — Cyber intelligence report on fraud targeting Peruvian government portals
-  **WAF Bypass in Wordfence** — Discovered an XSS exception in the world's most widely used WordPress security plugin, protecting ~3 million sites
